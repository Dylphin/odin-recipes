        <h1> Bacon for the Family </h1>

    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p>This is the way to get crisp bacon without having to constantly turn it, watch over it, or get burnt by splatters of grease. It 'fries' up flat and doesn't curl, which looks great beside a breakfast plate of eggs, and makes BLT sandwiches much easier. Very nice when feeding a family or crowd. </p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3> 
    <p> 
        <ul> 
            <li> 1 pound thick sliced bacon </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3> Steps </h3>

        <p>
           <ol> 
           <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange bacon on baking sheet in a single layer with the edges touching or slightly overlapping. </li>
        </p>
            <p>
                <li> 
            Bake in preheated oven to desired degree of doneness, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove bacon from the baking sheet with tongs or a fork, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
